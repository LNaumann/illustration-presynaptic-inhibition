#### Motivation

Networks of neurons can perform powerful computations that underlie complex cognitive functions. In those networks, inhibitory neurons are critical because, unlike excitatory neurons, they suppress neural activity, thereby expanding the range of possible computations. While inhibition is classically thought to decrease neural activity via postsynaptic receptors, there is mounting evidence for inhibition through presynaptic receptors. This illustration summarises the biological foundations of presynaptic inhibition and showcases its functional implications at the synaptic and network level.


#### Description

Biological background (top) and functional implications (bottom) of presynaptic inhibition in the brain.

Neurons transmit signals at synapses by releasing neurotransmitters (excitatory Glutamate and inhibitory GABA) that bind to receptors and thereby influence the activity of other neurons. In the classical picture, neurotransmitters are released by the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. However, the presynaptic side of a synapse can also express receptors, for example inhibitory presynaptic GABA receptors. Activation of such receptors lowers the release of neurotransmitters and thereby decreases the response in the postsynaptic neuron (synaptic mechanism). Since this mechanism targets the presynaptic side, it is called presynaptic inhibition. The GABA that targets presynaptic receptors is released by inhibitory interneurons with synapses near the targeted synapse (GABA spillover) or directly onto it (axo-axonic synapse). Candidate neurons for mediating presynaptic inhibition are inhibitory interneurons expressing the marker NDNF and SST.

The functional role of presynaptic inhibition is still an active area of research. At the synaptic level, activation of presynaptic GABA receptors reduces synaptic transmission. This can also modulate the short-term dynamics. With weak presynaptic inhibition synaptic resource deplete quickly, thus leading to depressing postsynaptic responses. With strong presynaptic inhibition, synaptic resources are retained for subsequent inputs, causing a facilitating postsynaptic response.
These synaptic effects have functional implications at the network level. Firstly, by inhibiting excitatory recurrent synapses in response to increased network activity, presynaptic inhibition can form a negative feedback loop that increases network stability. Secondly, inhibition of synaptic transmission can dynamically gate signals. When presynaptic inhibition is weak (for low inhibitory neuron activity), synaptic signals are transmitted, but when presynaptic inhibition is strong (high inhibitory neuron activity), the signals are attenuated. This form of synaptic gating can also be frequency-specific. Since presynaptic inhibition affects the short-term synaptic dynamics, it can regulate whether high frequencies (facilitating responses) or low frequencies (depressing responses) are preferentially transmitted.

In summary, presynaptic inhibition is a synaptic mechanism with intriguing network-level effects. Future research on the functional implications of presynaptic inhibition at the network level could unravel its role in dynamically shaping neuronal communication.
